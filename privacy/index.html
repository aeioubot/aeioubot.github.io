            <h1>Privacy policy for the Aeiou Discord bot</h1>
            <h2>Data collection</h2>
			<p>Aeiou only permanently stores custom reactions that have been set up using the <code>/cradd</code> command. For each custom reaction, the following is stored:
            <ul>
                <li>Information submitted through the command: trigger, response and matching method</li>
                <li>ID of the server where the custom reaction is active</li>
                <li>Time of creation</li>
            </ul>
            No personal data is ever collected.<br/><br/>
            To provide the service, Aeiou scans all messages sent in channels which it has access to for matching custom reactions set up in your server.
            If you wish to opt out of this behaviour and have all your messages ignored by the bot, send an e-mail to <code>privacy at aeiou.ooo</code> with your Discord user ID.
            </p>
            <h2>Data deletion</h2>
            <p>Custom reactions can be removed using the <code>/cradd</code> command.<br/>
            To store as little data as possible, user IDs are not collected. It is therefore impossible to find out which reactions <i>you</i> specifically submitted, or to delete those.
            </p>
            <h2>Changes to the Privacy Policy</h2>
            <p>This Privacy Policy may be revised at any time without prior notice.</p>
            <h2>Questions</h2>
            <p>If you have any questions, you may contact us by e-mail at <code>privacy at aeiou.ooo</code>.
            </p>
